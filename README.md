# Hack-a-fleet

This is the repository containing Python tools and additional datasets for \*Hack-A-Fleet v2.0".

# File descriptions

- `ferry_trips.xlsx`: An Excel file containing records of trips made by X ferries owned by FÃ¤rjerederiet. See the section "Ferry trips" below for more information about the contents.
- `ferries.json`: A JSON file containing additionsal information of the ferries named in the file `ferry_trips.xlsx`, such as the `pontos_vessel_id` for querying the REST-API of PONTOS-HUB.
- `utils.py`: A Python module containing utility functions to fetch vessel data from PONTOS-HUB, manipulate it, and visualize it.
- `examples.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing examples of the useage of the functions in `utils.py`.
- `extend_ferry_trips.py`: A Python script that extends the trip information of `ferry_trips.xlsx` using the data in PONTOS-HUB (e.g. distance and fuel consumption). Generates the file `extended_ferry_trips.csv`.
- `extended_ferry_trips.csv`: A CSV file generated by `extend_ferry_trips.py`. Contains the trip data in `ferry_trips.xlsx` and the extended information calculated from the data in PONTOS-HUB.

# Get Started with the Python tools

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a file called `.env` and save it the root directory (i.e. the same directory that contains `utils.py`). The content of the file must be:

```
PONTOS_TOKEN=<Your token obtained from pontos.ri.se>
```

This file is read by `utils.py` when loaded so that the requests to PONTOS-HUB are authorized.

3. Create a virtual environment (e.g. using `pyenv`or `conda`).

4. Install all the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5. Take a look at `examples.ipynb`.
